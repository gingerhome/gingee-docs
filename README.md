# GingerJS App Server Docs

**What is GingerJS?**

GingerJS is a secure, batteries-included Node.js application server designed to dramatically accelerate web app development. Co-authored by a human architect and a GenAI partner, it provides a full featured platform that allows developers to focus on business logic instead of boilerplate. It achieves this through a secure sandbox, a powerful module ecosystem, and a comprehensive application lifecycle management system.
